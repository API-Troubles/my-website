Whats Nest? Nest is a project by Hack Club which provides a free linux server for you to mess around with

Nest Management Bot (find it [here](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/D07QZ5L8TV5)) is a bot which can show you your running processes and systemd services, and play around with them. You can pause processes, resume them, kill them with 2 flavours (SIGTERM and SIGKILL), restart services, reload them, and it goes on! The bot provides useful information like service uptime and status, and things like process memory usage. It's built as a slack bot on the Hack Club slack, so it's very easy to access and use!

Too lazy to try it yourself? View a view demo [here](https://youtu.be/ADdXtVeMGrI) instead on YouTube :D. I encourage you to try the full bot though!
